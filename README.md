# Blokks starter theme

A dead-simple theme that you can build from. The primary purpose of this theme is 
to provide a file structure rather than a framework for markup or styles.

## Running scripts

Just run `npm run start` to create an optimized version of starter theme. Or copy 
all files into your own project and use your own task runners to build the theme.
